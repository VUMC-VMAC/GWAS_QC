Notes of things to (maybe) add the the GWAS QC scripts

Part 1
- color 5 sd outliers on het check plot

Part 2 
- save pre-imputation files in a separate folder?

Post-imputation
- fix the name of the pdf that's written to the log file (doesn't match the actual file that's created)

PC plotting
- add in a catch for the issue of duplicate variant IDs so that those variants are removed (rather than causing the script to fail)
- add a catch for id length to the PC calculation and plotting script (rather than having it within the GWAS QC part 1 script)

More on the TOPMed files side of things, but check to see why we are getting the "impossible allele assignment" warning when prepping for imputation.
