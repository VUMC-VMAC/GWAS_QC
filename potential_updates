Notes of this to (maybe) add the the GWAS QC scripts

Part 1
- optional argument of file to use to update sex
- fix the logging of number of related individuals (wc -l < filename rather than wc -l filename)

Part 2 
- flag/argument to indicate build of dataset
- save pre-imputation files in a separate folder?
